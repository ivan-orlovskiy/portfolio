# Portfolio projects

Contains two projects:
1. Shopper - my own application, that was like a side project. Application is still alive and gains new users, available on Anroid and IOS, link to the app: https://apps.apple.com/by/app/shopper-shared-shopping-list/id6476829315. Due to time restrictions layers and code entities like repos, repo interfaces and other sublayers were removed, main focus was on making working app (prototype ++) in small amount of time.
2. SwipeHR - my diploma project for uni graduation, not published. Cloud DB is not working rn, so it is just for code example.

I prefer not to disclose code samples from my previous jobs for reasons of professional ethics.
